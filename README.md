## üß≠ Introduction

**Trello Backup Utility** is a lightweight desktop utility designed to automatically back up your Trello boards, cards, comments, attachments, and metadata to CSV files for offline storage and long-term archiving.

Built with Python, the tool is cross-platform and ideal for both personal and organizational use.

Source code or snippits can be provided to Vendors and individuals upon request for security concerns.

While the source is still under NDA (since partly coded at work... whoops) I do have permission to release the binaries for public use. üòÑ

---

## üéØ Purpose / Use Case

Trello does not natively offer full offline backup options with attachments and comments. This tool was developed to:

- Archive active workspaces or boards
- Ensure project continuity if Trello access is lost
- Provide a CSV-based snapshot for audits, records, or migration
- Enable scheduled or manual backups
- Store backups securely in your own folders
- Avoid vendor lock-in

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup / Configuration

### ‚úÖ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Trello API key & token (stored securely using `keyring`)
- GUI or CLI available (depending on version)

### üîß First-Time Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the `.exe` (see [Downloads](https://github.com/lofiware/TrelloBackupUtility/releases))
2. Run the app and follow the authentication prompts
3. Choose which Trello boards to back up
4. Select an output folder (remembered for next time)
5. Customize options like:
   - Include closed cards
   - Include attachments
   - Save log file

## üì¶ Downloads

### üñ•Ô∏è Windows Executable
Latest release: [trello-backup-tool-v1.0.0.exe](https://github.com/lofiware/TrelloBackupUtility/releases)

No Python installation required. Download and run.

---

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Restores
Currently, this tool does not support restoring data to Trello.

Backups are structured in a way that makes partial manual recreation easy if necessary:

Each board gets its own folder

Each card is represented as a row with metadata

Attachments are downloaded into corresponding card subfolders

Comments, checklists, and labels are stored per card

Planned restore options are in the Roadmap.

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap
*Add automated scheduled backups

*Implement restore-to-Trello via API (optional)

*Support for JSON format alongside CSV

*Cloud backup integrations (Dropbox, GDrive, S3)

*Command-line options and headless mode

*Multi-user or team support

See Issues for more.
