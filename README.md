## üß≠ Introduction

**Trello Backup Utility** is a lightweight desktop utility designed to automatically back up your Trello boards, cards, comments, attachments, and metadata to CSV files for offline storage and long-term archiving.

Built with Python, the tool is cross-platform and ideal for both personal and organizational use.

---

## üéØ Purpose / Use Case

Trello does not natively offer full offline backup options with attachments and comments. This tool was developed to:

- Archive active workspaces or boards
- Ensure project continuity if Trello access is lost
- Provide a CSV-based snapshot for audits, records, or migration
- Enable scheduled or manual backups
- Store backups securely in your own folders
- Avoid vendor lock-in

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup / Configuration

### ‚úÖ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Trello API key & token (stored securely using `keyring`)
- GUI or CLI available (depending on version)

### üîß First-Time Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the `.exe` (see [Downloads](#downloads))
2. Run the app and follow the authentication prompts
3. Choose which Trello boards to back up
4. Select an output folder (remembered for next time)
5. Customize options like:
   - Include closed cards
   - Include attachments
   - Save log file

## üì¶ Downloads

### üñ•Ô∏è Windows Executable
Latest release: [trello-backup-tool-v1.0.0.exe](https://github.com/lofiware/TrelloBackupUtility/releases)

No Python installation required. Download and run.

---

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Restores
Currently, this tool does not support restoring data to Trello.

Backups are structured in a way that makes partial manual recreation easy if necessary:

Each board gets its own folder

Each card is represented as a row with metadata

Attachments are downloaded into corresponding card subfolders

Comments, checklists, and labels are stored per card

Planned restore options are in the Roadmap.

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap
*Add automated scheduled backups

*Implement restore-to-Trello via API (optional)

*Support for JSON format alongside CSV

*Cloud backup integrations (Dropbox, GDrive, S3)

*Command-line options and headless mode

*Multi-user or team support

See Issues for more.
