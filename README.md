# Introduction
The Trello Backup Utility is a self-contained offline backup tool that simplifies the entire process of backup and restore of your critical Trello workspaces, boards, lists, all the way down to your comments.
It does this using the Trello API, so internet is required to make the backup.

It is simple to set up, and simple to use. While being very powerful and effective at its specific task.

Trello boards are link to the user identified by the TRELLO_KEY and TRELLO_TOKEN. Meaning you cannot backup a board you are not part of. Please see multiple account configurations if this is needed.
